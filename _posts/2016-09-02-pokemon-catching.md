  Driving from Jacksonville to Orlando, we stopped to have a quick look at one

  Pokémon GO.

Driving from Jacksonville to Orlando, we stopped to have a quick look at one of the many fabulous beaches, only to find a gathering of people all looking at their screens. Families were arriving in droves, carrying devices of all shapes and sizes. People even had deck chairs all circled in one area. Why? _[Pokémon GO][0]**.**_

We stopped to ask two young men what they were up to and sure enough they too were chasing Pokémon. I hoped they didn't mind my saying it all looked a bit odd. The coastline was stunning. They agreed first time they had seen people staring at their screens in lines racing as a Pokémon appeared, they too had found it odd. But, once you've tried it you are hooked I was told. Had I tried? No, at least not yet.

It raised interesting questions for me. Where they interacting more, or less or simply differently with each other and the world?

So what were they doing? They were waiting for eggs to hatch, there were three I believe and in the hope of a rare Pokémon appearing and helping the player reach the next level, they swarmed around and then ran as eggs hatched.

It was not just children, but a wide range of ages and even groupings. As [Andrew Baulcomb][1] mentioned, of the 600 million users, over 40% are over 25 and a third are women. This is clearly a game not just for children. However, more than this it appeared this was clearly a very social game;where couples, families, groups of friends all converged in a space and time, led by the lure of Pokémon.

Since it's launch and initial surge in popularity there has been talk of a demise, but with innovations in human-Pokémon interaction like the Buddy system (reported by [Forbes][2]) I see an evolving paradigm of interaction both in how we [access the geography of our cities][3] and interact with the people in them.
